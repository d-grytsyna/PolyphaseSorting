<h2>Polyphase sorting implementation</h2>

<h6>The idea of multiphase sorting
is that of the three auxiliary files available, 2 files are used for inputting the sequences to be merged, and one is used for outputting the resulting series. As soon as one of the input files becomes empty, it is used to output the sequences obtained by merging the sequences of the new set of 2 files.

Achieved sorting speed of
1GB per 3 minutes.
Pre-ordered series of items with a length of
at least 100MB in length using quick sort to speed up the
the sorting process.
